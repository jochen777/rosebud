# rosebud
The brand new, pragmatic, compact, fast and component based webframework to generate websites.


You love your java http-webframework, but disappointed about low construction capabilities?
Then put rosebud on top of your framework (play, spring, dropwizard, spark ... you name it) and get powerful and reusable components.

Rosebud is one of the rare pure component based approaches. And it is very easy to use: If you could write JSON, you could construct Rosebud pages.
